# publishing-toolset

The idea behind this toolset is to provide a basic set of utilities to manage building HTML, CSS and Javascript content for digital publishing. It also accompanies the article [Trimming the CSS Fat](http://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/trimming-the-css-fat) and provides a starting point for further research and development.
